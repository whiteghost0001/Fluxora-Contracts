///    - Too small (e.g., 10): More pages = more I/O for full index traversal
///    - Too large (e.g., 1000): Higher per-operation cost, approaching storage limits
///
/// 3. **Mutation Cost**: Adding/removing streams touches at most 2 pages (200 IDs = 1.6KB),
///    keeping mutation costs predictable and bounded at O(1).
///
/// 4. **Pagination UX**: 100 streams per page provides reasonable granularity for UI

///
/// # Versioning policy
///
/// | Change type | Action required |
/// |-------------|-----------------|
/// | Breaking ABI change (renamed/removed entry-point, changed parameter order, changed error codes, changed event shape) | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` |
/// | New entry-point that is purely additive (old clients can ignore it) | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` (conservative; recommended) |
/// | Internal refactor with identical external behaviour | No increment required |
/// | Documentation-only change | No increment required |
///
/// ## What counts as breaking
/// - Removing or renaming a public function
/// - Changing the type or order of any function parameter
/// - Changing a `ContractError` discriminant value
/// - Changing the shape of an emitted event payload (`StreamCreated`, `Withdrawal`, etc.)
/// - Changing storage key layout in a way that makes existing persistent entries unreadable
///
/// ## What does NOT require an increment
/// - Adding a new public function (additive)
/// - Tightening validation (e.g. rejecting a previously-accepted edge case) — but document it
/// - Gas optimisations with identical observable behaviour
/// - Changing TTL bump constants
///
/// # Migration notes for operators
///
/// Soroban contracts are **not upgradeable in-place** by default. A new version means:
/// 1. Deploy a new contract instance (new `CONTRACT_ID`).
/// 2. Call `init` on the new instance with the same token and admin.
/// 3. Migrate active streams off-chain: cancel or let them complete on the old instance,
///    then recreate on the new instance if needed.
/// 4. Update all integrations (wallets, indexers, treasury tooling) to point at the new
///    `CONTRACT_ID` and verify `version()` returns the expected value before use.
/// 5. Announce the migration with sufficient lead time so recipients can withdraw
///    accrued funds from the old instance before it is abandoned.
///
/// There is no on-chain migration path between versions. All stream state is local to
/// the contract instance that created it.
///
/// # Residual risk
/// - If an operator forgets to increment this constant before deploying a breaking change,
///   integrators will not detect the incompatibility until a runtime failure occurs.
///   Code review and CI checks on this constant are the primary safeguard.
///
/// Bumped to 2: `Stream` struct gained `checkpointed_amount: i128` and `checkpointed_at: u64`
/// for safe rate-decrease support (see `decrease_rate_per_second`).
///
/// Bumped to 3: `delegated_withdraw` signature payload now commits to
/// `expected_minimum_amount` to close the relayer front-running griefing vector.

    /// - If `start_time` is before the current ledger timestamp (past start time)

    ///
    /// # Events
    /// - Publishes `created(stream_id, deposit_amount)` event on success
    ///
    /// # Usage Notes
    /// - Self-streaming is disallowed: `sender` must be different from `recipient`
    ///   - Violations panic with `"sender and recipient must be different"`
    ///   - No state is persisted, no tokens move, and no `created` event is emitted
    /// - Transaction is atomic: if token transfer fails, no stream is created
    /// - Stream IDs are sequential starting from 0
    /// - Cliff time enables vesting schedules (no withdrawals before cliff)
    /// - Setting `cliff_time = start_time` means no cliff (immediate vesting)
    /// - Deposit can exceed minimum required (excess remains in contract)
    /// - Sender must have sufficient token balance and approve contract
    /// ## Stream Limits Policy
    /// No hard upper bounds (e.g. "max 1 million tokens") are enforced on `deposit_amount`
    /// beyond the technical limit of `i128::MAX` and the underlying token's supply.
    /// Rationale:
    /// - Overflow in accrual math is already prevented via `checked_mul` and clamping (Issue #6).
    /// - A fixed arbitrary cap would require a contract upgrade to change and conflicts with
    ///   the overflow test suite, which exercises values up to `i128::MAX`.
    /// - Protocol-specific or business-driven limits belong at the application layer.
    /// - This contract remains "defense in depth" by ensuring math safety at all scales.
    ///
    /// Senders are responsible for the correctness of the values they supply.
    /// The validations above (`deposit > 0`, `rate > 0`, `deposit >= rate × duration`,
    /// valid time window) are the contract's complete set of creation constraints.
    ///
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `ContractError` if:
    /// - `ContractPaused` (4): Operations are globally halted; new streams cannot be created.
    /// - `InvalidParams` (3): Negative values, zero durations, or insufficient starting deposit.
    /// - `StartTimeInPast` (5): The `start_time` is strictly before the current ledger timestamp.
    /// - `ArithmeticOverflow` (6): Value conversions or deposit sum exceeds safe capacities.
    /// - `Unauthorized` (7): Sender signature is missing.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// - Linear stream: 1000 tokens over 1000 seconds, no cliff
    ///   - `deposit_amount = 1000`, `rate = 1`, `start = 0`, `cliff = 0`, `end = 1000`

    /// to absolute timestamps and delegates to `create_streams`. Provides the same
    /// atomicity and gas efficiency as `create_streams` while eliminating off-chain

    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `sender`: Address funding all streams in the batch

    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// - `Vec<u64>`: Stream IDs in the same order as `streams_relative` input entries
    ///
    /// # Authorization
    /// - Requires authorization from `sender` exactly once for the entire batch
    ///
    /// # Time Computation
    /// Uses `current_time = env.ledger().timestamp()`:
    /// For each entry:
    /// - `start_time = current_time + start_delay`
    /// - `cliff_time = current_time + cliff_delay`

    ///
    /// # Success Semantics
    /// - Empty batch returns `Ok(Vec::new())` without side effects
    /// - All validation invariants from `create_streams` are preserved
    /// - Relative timing eliminates `StartTimeInPast` errors
    /// - Single token transfer for all streams (atomic)
    ///
    /// # Failure Semantics
    /// - Any entry's time offset causes arithmetic overflow → `InvalidParams`
    /// - Any validation failure → entire batch fails atomically
    /// - Any token transfer failure → no state change
    /// - No events emitted on failure

    ///   via `withdraw()`.
    /// - The contract does **not** auto-transfer accrued funds to the recipient when
    ///   cancelling; the recipient must explicitly withdraw.

    /// # Examples
    /// - Cancel at 30% completion → sender gets 70% refund, recipient can withdraw 30%
    /// - Cancel at 100% completion → sender gets 0% refund, recipient can withdraw 100%

/// Atomically cancel multiple streams owned by the caller and refund the aggregate
/// unstreamed balance in a single token transfer.
///
/// This is the batch counterpart to `cancel_stream`. It provides gas-efficient
/// off-boarding for senders managing large portfolios (up to `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` streams).
///
/// # Two-phase execution
/// 1. **Validation phase**: Every `stream_id` is loaded and verified:
///    - Stream must exist (`StreamNotFound` otherwise).
///    - Caller must be the stream sender (`Unauthorized` otherwise).
///    - Stream must be in `Active` or `Paused` state (`InvalidState` otherwise).
///    - Duplicate `stream_id`s are rejected (`DuplicateStreamId`).
/// 2. **Execution phase**: Only after all validations pass:
///    - Per-stream accrued amount is computed.
///    - Recipient is paid their accrued entitlement (individual transfers).
///    - Stream is marked `Cancelled` with `cancelled_at` timestamp.
///    - `StreamCancelled` event is emitted per stream.
///    - Aggregate refund is computed and sent to the sender in **one** token transfer.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `stream_ids`: Vector of stream IDs to cancel. Must be unique. Max length is
///   bounded by the caller's transaction resources; the contract enforces no hard
///   limit beyond Soroban's own VM limits, but `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 100` is the
///   recommended batch size for gas predictability.
///
/// # Authorization
/// - Requires authorization from the caller (who must be the sender of every stream).
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Ok(())` on success.
///
/// # Errors
/// - `ContractError::DuplicateStreamId` (14): Duplicate IDs in `stream_ids`.
/// - `ContractError::StreamNotFound` (1): A stream ID does not exist.
/// - `ContractError::Unauthorized` (7): Caller is not the sender of a stream.
/// - `ContractError::InvalidState` (2): A stream is not `Active` or `Paused`.
/// - `ContractError::ContractPaused` (4): Global emergency pause is active.
///
/// # Gas efficiency
/// - One auth check for the entire batch.
/// - One token transfer for the aggregate refund (vs. N transfers for N individual
///   `cancel_stream` calls).
/// - Per-stream recipient transfers are still individual (required for correct
///   accounting and event emission), but the sender refund is batched.
///
/// # Events
/// - One `StreamCancelled` event per successfully cancelled stream.
/// - One `cancelled` topic event per stream (same shape as `cancel_stream`).
///
/// # Security
/// - Atomic: any failure in validation or execution reverts the entire batch.
/// - CEI pattern: state is persisted before every external token transfer.
/// - Liabilities are reduced per-stream before the aggregate refund.
