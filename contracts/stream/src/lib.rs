///
/// # Versioning policy
///
/// | Change type | Action required |
/// |-------------|-----------------|
/// | Breaking ABI change (renamed/removed entry-point, changed parameter order, changed error codes, changed event shape) | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` |
/// | New entry-point that is purely additive (old clients can ignore it) | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` (conservative; recommended) |
/// | Internal refactor with identical external behaviour | No increment required |
/// | Documentation-only change | No increment required |
///
/// ## What counts as breaking
/// - Removing or renaming a public function
/// - Changing the type or order of any function parameter
/// - Changing a `ContractError` discriminant value
/// - Changing the shape of an emitted event payload (`StreamCreated`, `Withdrawal`, etc.)
/// - Changing storage key layout in a way that makes existing persistent entries unreadable
///
/// ## What does NOT require an increment
/// - Adding a new public function (additive)
/// - Tightening validation (e.g. rejecting a previously-accepted edge case) — but document it
/// - Gas optimisations with identical observable behaviour
/// - Changing TTL bump constants
///
/// # Migration notes for operators
///
/// Soroban contracts are **not upgradeable in-place** by default. A new version means:
/// 1. Deploy a new contract instance (new `CONTRACT_ID`).
/// 2. Call `init` on the new instance with the same token and admin.
/// 3. Migrate active streams off-chain: cancel or let them complete on the old instance,
///    then recreate on the new instance if needed.
/// 4. Update all integrations (wallets, indexers, treasury tooling) to point at the new
///    `CONTRACT_ID` and verify `version()` returns the expected value before use.
/// 5. Announce the migration with sufficient lead time so recipients can withdraw
///    accrued funds from the old instance before it is abandoned.
///
/// There is no on-chain migration path between versions. All stream state is local to
/// the contract instance that created it.
///
/// # Residual risk
/// - If an operator forgets to increment this constant before deploying a breaking change,
///   integrators will not detect the incompatibility until a runtime failure occurs.
///   Code review and CI checks on this constant are the primary safeguard.
///
/// Bumped to 5: `withdraw_dust_threshold: i128` added to `Stream` struct and creation params
/// to reduce fee/event spam from tiny withdrawals.

    ///   - No state is persisted, no tokens move, and no `created` event is emitted
    /// - Transaction is atomic: if token transfer fails, no stream is created
    /// - Stream IDs are sequential starting from 0
    /// - Cliff time enables vesting schedules (no withdrawals before cliff)
    /// - Setting `cliff_time = start_time` means no cliff (immediate vesting)
    /// - Deposit can exceed minimum required (excess remains in contract)
    /// - Sender must have sufficient token balance and approve contract
    /// ## Stream Limits Policy
    /// No hard upper bounds (e.g. "max 1 million tokens") are enforced on `deposit_amount`
    /// beyond the technical limit of `i128::MAX` and the underlying token's supply.
    /// Rationale:
    /// - Overflow in accrual math is already prevented via `checked_mul` and clamping (Issue #6).
    /// - A fixed arbitrary cap would require a contract upgrade to change and conflicts with
    ///   the overflow test suite, which exercises values up to `i128::MAX`.
    /// - Protocol-specific or business-driven limits belong at the application layer.
    /// - This contract remains "defense in depth" by ensuring math safety at all scales.
    ///
    /// Senders are responsible for the correctness of the values they supply.
    /// The validations above (`deposit > 0`, `rate > 0`, `deposit >= rate × duration`,
    /// valid time window) are the contract's complete set of creation constraints.
    ///
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `ContractError` if:
    /// - `ContractPaused` (4): Operations are globally halted; new streams cannot be created.
    /// - `InvalidParams` (3): Negative values, zero durations, or insufficient starting deposit.
    /// - `StartTimeInPast` (5): The `start_time` is strictly before the current ledger timestamp.
    /// - `ArithmeticOverflow` (6): Value conversions or deposit sum exceeds safe capacities.
    /// - `Unauthorized` (7): Sender signature is missing.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// - Linear stream: 1000 tokens over 1000 seconds, no cliff
    ///   - `deposit_amount = 1000`, `rate = 1`, `start = 0`, `cliff = 0`, `end = 1000`
