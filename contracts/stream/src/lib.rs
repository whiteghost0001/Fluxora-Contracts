/// 1. **Soroban Storage Limits**: Each persistent storage entry has a practical limit

///    headroom for serialization overhead and metadata.
///
/// 2. **Gas Efficiency**: Loading/saving 100 IDs is a single persistent I/O operation.
///    - Too small (e.g., 10): More pages = more I/O for full index traversal
///    - Too large (e.g., 1000): Higher per-operation cost, approaching storage limits
///
/// 3. **Mutation Cost**: Adding/removing streams touches at most 2 pages (200 IDs = 1.6KB),
///    keeping mutation costs predictable and bounded at O(1).
///
/// 4. **Pagination UX**: 100 streams per page provides reasonable granularity for UI
///    pagination without excessive round-trips.
///
/// 5. **Worst-Case Bounds**: With 100 IDs per page:
///    - 1,000 streams: 10 pages, ~8KB total storage
///    - 10,000 streams: 100 pages, ~80KB total storage (approaching practical limits)

/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **Add stream**: O(1) - touches last page only (~2,500 CPU instructions)
/// - **Remove stream**: O(1) amortized - touches ≤2 pages (~3,400 CPU instructions)
/// - **Query page**: O(1) - loads single page (~850 CPU instructions)
/// - **Query all**: O(Pages) - loads all pages (~850 × Pages CPU instructions)

// Contract version
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// truth that integrators, deployment scripts, and indexers use to detect
/// which protocol revision is running on-chain.
///
/// # Versioning policy
///
/// | Change type | Action required |
/// |-------------|-----------------|
/// | Breaking ABI change (renamed/removed entry-point, changed parameter order, changed error codes, changed event shape) | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` |
/// | New entry-point that is purely additive (old clients can ignore it) | Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION` (conservative; recommended) |
/// | Internal refactor with identical external behaviour | No increment required |
/// | Documentation-only change | No increment required |
///
/// ## What counts as breaking
/// - Removing or renaming a public function
/// - Changing the type or order of any function parameter
/// - Changing a `ContractError` discriminant value
/// - Changing the shape of an emitted event payload (`StreamCreated`, `Withdrawal`, etc.)
/// - Changing storage key layout in a way that makes existing persistent entries unreadable
///
/// ## What does NOT require an increment
/// - Adding a new public function (additive)
/// - Tightening validation (e.g. rejecting a previously-accepted edge case) — but document it
/// - Gas optimisations with identical observable behaviour
/// - Changing TTL bump constants
///
/// # Migration notes for operators
///
/// Soroban contracts are **not upgradeable in-place** by default. A new version means:
/// 1. Deploy a new contract instance (new `CONTRACT_ID`).
/// 2. Call `init` on the new instance with the same token and admin.
/// 3. Migrate active streams off-chain: cancel or let them complete on the old instance,
///    then recreate on the new instance if needed.
/// 4. Update all integrations (wallets, indexers, treasury tooling) to point at the new
///    `CONTRACT_ID` and verify `version()` returns the expected value before use.
/// 5. Announce the migration with sufficient lead time so recipients can withdraw
///    accrued funds from the old instance before it is abandoned.
///
/// There is no on-chain migration path between versions. All stream state is local to
/// the contract instance that created it.
///
/// # Residual risk
/// - If an operator forgets to increment this constant before deploying a breaking change,
///   integrators will not detect the incompatibility until a runtime failure occurs.
///   Code review and CI checks on this constant are the primary safeguard.
/// Bumped to 2: `Stream` struct gained `checkpointed_amount: i128` and `checkpointed_at: u64`
/// for safe rate-decrease support (see `decrease_rate_per_second`).
/// Bumped to 3: `delegated_withdraw` signature payload now commits to
/// `expected_minimum_amount` to close the relayer front-running griefing vector.

/// # Evolution policy
///
/// `DataKey` is a `#[contracttype]` enum. Soroban serialises enum variants by
/// their **discriminant index** (0-based, in declaration order). Changing the
/// order of existing variants, or inserting a new variant anywhere other than
/// the **end** of the enum, will silently shift all subsequent discriminants
/// and make every existing persistent storage entry unreadable.
///
/// Rules for contributors:
/// 1. **Never reorder** existing variants.
/// 2. **Never remove** a variant that has ever been written to a live network.
///    Mark it deprecated in a doc comment instead and stop writing to it.
/// 3. **Always append** new variants at the end of the enum.
/// 4. **Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION`** whenever a new variant is added or an
///    existing variant's associated type changes — both are breaking changes
///    for any off-chain tool that reads storage directly.
/// 5. Document the ledger at which each variant was first deployed so that
///    migration tooling can determine which entries exist on a given instance.
///
/// Current discriminant assignments (must never change) — see enum definition below for order.

    /// # Panics
    /// - If `start_time` is before the current ledger timestamp (past start time)
    ///   - Uses `ContractError::StartTimeInPast` (structured error for integrators)
    /// - If `deposit_amount` or `rate_per_second` is not positive

    /// - Transfers `deposit_amount` tokens from sender to contract
    /// - Creates new stream with status `Active`
    /// - Increments global stream counter
    /// - Stores stream data in persistent storage with extended TTL
    ///
    /// # Events
    /// - Publishes `created(stream_id, deposit_amount)` event on success
    ///
    /// # Usage Notes
    /// - Self-streaming is disallowed: `sender` must be different from `recipient`
    ///   - Violations panic with `"sender and recipient must be different"`
    ///   - No state is persisted, no tokens move, and no `created` event is emitted
    /// - Transaction is atomic: if token transfer fails, no stream is created
    /// - Stream IDs are sequential starting from 0
    /// - Cliff time enables vesting schedules (no withdrawals before cliff)
    /// - Setting `cliff_time = start_time` means no cliff (immediate vesting)
    /// - Deposit can exceed minimum required (excess remains in contract)
    /// - Sender must have sufficient token balance and approve contract
    /// ## Stream Limits Policy
    /// No hard upper bounds (e.g. "max 1 million tokens") are enforced on `deposit_amount`
    /// beyond the technical limit of `i128::MAX` and the underlying token's supply.
    /// Rationale:
    /// - Overflow in accrual math is already prevented via `checked_mul` and clamping (Issue #6).
    /// - A fixed arbitrary cap would require a contract upgrade to change and conflicts with
    ///   the overflow test suite, which exercises values up to `i128::MAX`.
    /// - Protocol-specific or business-driven limits belong at the application layer.
    /// - This contract remains "defense in depth" by ensuring math safety at all scales.
    ///
    /// Senders are responsible for the correctness of the values they supply.
    /// The validations above (`deposit > 0`, `rate > 0`, `deposit >= rate × duration`,
    /// valid time window) are the contract's complete set of creation constraints.
    ///
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `ContractError` if:
    /// - `ContractPaused` (4): Operations are globally halted; new streams cannot be created.
    /// - `InvalidParams` (3): Negative values, zero durations, or insufficient starting deposit.
    /// - `StartTimeInPast` (5): The `start_time` is strictly before the current ledger timestamp.
    /// - `ArithmeticOverflow` (6): Value conversions or deposit sum exceeds safe capacities.
    /// - `Unauthorized` (7): Sender signature is missing.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// - Linear stream: 1000 tokens over 1000 seconds, no cliff
    ///   - `deposit_amount = 1000`, `rate = 1`, `start = 0`, `cliff = 0`, `end = 1000`

    /// - Requires authorization from `sender` exactly once for the entire batch

    /// # Success Semantics
    /// - Every entry is validated using the same rules as `create_stream`
    /// - The total deposit is computed as `sum(entry.deposit_amount)` with checked arithmetic

    /// - `ContractPaused` (4): Operations are globally halted; batch creation is completely blocked.

    /// - `ArithmeticOverflow` (6): Value conversions or total batch deposit exceeds `i128::MAX`.
    /// - `Unauthorized` (7): Sender signature is missing.

    /// # Panics
    /// - If token transfer fails due to sender balance/allowance constraints

    /// - Requires `sender.require_auth()` (single auth check for entire batch)

    ///
    /// # Empty Vector Semantics
    /// When `streams` is empty:
    /// - Returns `Ok(Vec::new())` (empty result vector)

    /// # Success Semantics
    /// When `streams` is non-empty:
    /// 1. All entries are validated before any state changes (first pass)
