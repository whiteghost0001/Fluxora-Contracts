## What's in this repo

- **Stream contract** (`contracts/stream`) — Lock USDC, accrue per second, withdraw on demand.
- **Data model** — `Stream` (sender, recipient, deposit_amount, rate_per_second, start/cliff/end time, withdrawn_amount, status, cancelled_at).
- **Status** — `Active`, `Paused`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`.

> `cancel_stream` and `cancel_stream_as_admin` are valid only when status is `Active` or `Paused`. Streams in `Completed` or `Cancelled` state return `ContractError::InvalidState`. After cancellation, accrual is frozen at `cancelled_at`; the recipient may still withdraw the frozen accrued amount.

## Tech stack

- Rust (edition 2021)
- [soroban-sdk](https://docs.rs/soroban-sdk) 21.7.7 (Stellar Soroban)
- Build target: `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for deployment

## Version pinning

This project pins dependencies for **reproducible builds** and **auditor compatibility**:

| Component       | Version | Location                      | Purpose                                          |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Rust**        | 1.75    | `rust-toolchain.toml`         | Ensures consistent WASM compilation              |
| **soroban-sdk** | 21.7.7  | `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml` | Locked to tested Stellar Soroban network version |

When upgrading versions:

1. Update `rust-toolchain.toml` → run `rustup update` → rebuild and test
2. Update `soroban-sdk` version in `Cargo.toml` → update lock file → run full test suite
3. Verify compatibility with the target Stellar network (testnet, mainnet)
4. Document the change in the PR or release notes

## Local setup

### Clone and prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fluxora-Org/Fluxora-Contracts.git
cd Fluxora-Contracts
```

- **Rust 1.75+** — Pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (auto-enforced via `rustup`)
- **Soroban SDK 21.7.7** — Pinned in `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml` for reproducible builds
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools) (optional, for deploy/test on network)

Install dependencies:

```bash
rustup update stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then verify:

```bash
rustc --version       # Should show 1.75 or newer
cargo --version
stellar --version     # Only if installing Stellar CLI
```

### Build

From the repo root:

```bash
# Development build (faster compile, for local testing)
cargo build -p fluxora_stream

# Release build (optimized WASM for deployment)
cargo build --release -p fluxora_stream --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Release WASM output: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fluxora_stream.wasm`.

### Run tests

```bash
cargo test -p fluxora_stream
```

Runs all unit and integration tests. No environment variables or external services required — Soroban's in-process test environment (`soroban_sdk::testutils`) simulates the ledger and a mock Stellar asset in memory.

Test files:

- **Unit tests**: `contracts/stream/src/test.rs` — contract logic, accrual math, auth, edge cases, i128 boundary scenarios, version policy.
- **Integration tests**: `contracts/stream/tests/integration_suite.rs` — full flows with `init`, `create_stream`, `withdraw`, `get_stream_state`, lifecycle transitions, and edge cases.
- **Property-based balance-conservation harness**: `contracts/stream/tests/balance_conservation.rs` — randomized sequences of `top_up`, `decrease_rate`, `shorten`, `extend`, `pause/resume`, `cancel`, and `withdraw` on both `Linear` and `CliffOnly` streams. Asserts global token conservation, accrual monotonicity, the rate-decrease checkpoint invariant, and `CliffOnly` unsupported-operation guards. Regression seeds live in `contracts/stream/proptest-regressions/`.

Run the new harness with a bounded case count for CI:

```bash
cargo test -p fluxora_stream --features testutils --test balance_conservation
```

For deeper local coverage before an audit or release:

```bash
PROPTEST_CASES=10000 cargo test -p fluxora_stream --features testutils --test balance_conservation
```

### Deploy to Stellar Testnet

> **See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the complete step-by-step deployment checklist.**

Quick start:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your STELLAR_SECRET_KEY, STELLAR_TOKEN_ADDRESS, STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS

source .env
bash script/deploy-testnet.sh
```

Contract ID is saved to `.contract_id`. Verify the deployment with:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $(cat .contract_id) -- version
stellar contract invoke --id $(cat .contract_id) -- get_config
```

## Accrual formula (reference)

```
if current_time < cliff_time  →  0
else  →  min((min(current_time, end_time) − start_time) × rate_per_second, deposit_amount)
```

- **Withdrawable** = `accrued − withdrawn_amount`
- Accrual is capped at `end_time` — no extra accrual after the stream ends.
- Multiplication overflow in accrual falls back to `deposit_amount` (safe upper bound).
- Cancelled streams: accrual is frozen at `cancelled_at`.
- Completed streams: `calculate_accrued` returns `deposit_amount` deterministically.

## WASM build hash verification

After each CI build, the pipeline computes a SHA256 hash of the contract WASM artifact and uploads it as a CI artifact. This allows deployers and auditors to verify that the deployed contract matches the tested build.

To verify a deployment:

1. Download the hash artifact from the CI run (GitHub Actions → Artifacts → `fluxora_stream-wasm-hash`).
2. Rebuild locally and verify against the committed reference:
   ```bash
   bash script/verify-wasm-checksum.sh
   ```
3. Or verify existing artifacts without rebuilding:
   ```bash
   bash script/verify-wasm-checksum.sh --no-build
   ```

To update checksums after a source change:

```bash
bash script/update-wasm-checksums.sh
git add wasm/checksums.sha256
git commit -m "chore: update wasm checksums"
```

See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md#reproducible-wasm-builds) for the full reproducibility contract, auditor verification steps, and residual risks.

## 🏭 Factory Contract
The Factory contract anchors the workspace deployment ecosystem by supervising global templates, managing operational scopes, and generating token-bound stream addresses.

* **Initialization (`init`):** Seals factory state parameters, configuring fundamental baseline settings and mapping the primary admin profile.
* **Policy Setters:** Secure administration entry-points governing structural template overrides, fee parameters, and network ownership allocations.
* **Stream Creation (`create_stream`):** Instantiates an isolated stream proxy sequence matched precisely against the active, verified template hash register.

> For deployment parameter schemas, factory variables, and initialization matrices, see [docs/factory.md](docs/factory.md).

---

## ⚖️ Governance Contract
The Governance module coordinates community actions, parameter threshold overrides, and critical upgrade vectors via verifiable checkpoint logic.

* **Proposal Lifecycles (`propose` / `approve` / `execute`):** Standard multi-signature/voting pipeline driving states from conception through validation rounds directly into on-chain enforcement.
* **Signer Management:** Updates administrative sign-off lists, multisig weights, and required confirmation consensus thresholds.

> For technical consensus models, voter profiles, and cryptographic execution matrices, see [docs/governance.md](docs/governance.md).

---

## 🛠️ Compilation and Local Development

All three workspace contract modules are structured to build simultaneously under standard WebAssembly environments. To compile `stream`, `factory`, and `governance` uniformly in a single action, run:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --workspace
