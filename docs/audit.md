# Audit preparation

This document lists all public entrypoints and core invariants of the Fluxora stream contract to help external auditors scope the review. It is accurate as of the current codebase; no code changes are implied.

## Types (reference)

- **Config**: `{ token: Address, admin: Address }`
- **Stream**: `stream_id: u64`, `sender: Address`, `recipient: Address`, `deposit_amount: i128`, `rate_per_second: i128`, `start_time: u64`, `cliff_time: u64`, `end_time: u64`, `withdrawn_amount: i128`, `status: StreamStatus`, `cancelled_at: Option<u64>`
- **StreamStatus**: `Active` \| `Paused` \| `Completed` \| `Cancelled`

---

## Invariants

Auditors can use these as a checklist; the implementation is intended to preserve them across all operations.

1. **Accrued never exceeds deposit**  
   `calculate_accrued` (and thus accrued amount used in withdraw/cancel) is clamped to `[0, deposit_amount]`. Overflow in rate × time is capped to `deposit_amount`.

2. **Withdrawn amount never exceeds deposit**  
   `withdrawn_amount` is only increased by `withdraw` by the withdrawable amount (accrued − withdrawn_amount), and stream becomes Completed when `withdrawn_amount == deposit_amount`; no further withdrawals allowed.

3. **Only the recipient can withdraw**  
   `withdraw` requires `stream.recipient.require_auth()`; sender and admin cannot withdraw on behalf of the recipient.

4. **Stream IDs are unique**  
   IDs are assigned from a monotonically increasing `NextStreamId` counter; no reuse or gap-fill. For complete stream ID semantics including monotonicity guarantees, uniqueness proofs, counter management, batch operations, economic conservation, payout ordering, and verification commands, see [stream-id-monotonicity-uniqueness.md](./stream-id-monotonicity-uniqueness.md).

5. **Sender ≠ recipient**  
   Enforced in `create_stream`; self-streaming is disallowed.

6. **Deposit covers total streamable amount**  
   `deposit_amount >= rate_per_second × (end_time − start_time)` is enforced in `create_stream`.

7. **Deposit sufficiency preserved on extension**  
   `extend_stream_end_time` re-validates `deposit_amount >= rate_per_second × (new_end_time − start_time)` before updating `end_time`. If the check fails, the call panics and no state changes occur. No token transfer happens on extension — the deposit already held in the contract must cover the longer duration. Use `top_up_stream` first if the current deposit is insufficient.

8. **Time bounds**  
   `start_time < end_time` and `cliff_time ∈ [start_time, end_time]` are enforced in `create_stream`.

9. **Init once (authenticated bootstrap)**  
   `init` requires admin authorization and panics if config already exists; token is immutable after init and admin changes only via `set_admin`.

10. **Pause / resume / cancel authorization**  
    `pause_stream`, `resume_stream`, and `cancel_stream` require sender auth. The `_as_admin` variants require admin auth and provide the same behaviour. Only the recipient can call `withdraw`.

11. **Status transitions**
    - Pause: only Active → Paused.
    - Resume: only Paused → Active.
    - Cancel: only Active or Paused → Cancelled.
    - Withdraw: when `withdrawn_amount` reaches `deposit_amount`, status becomes Completed.  
      Completed and Cancelled are terminal.

12. **Cancellation timestamp and refund semantics**

- On successful cancel, `cancelled_at` is set to current ledger timestamp.
- Accrual for cancelled streams is frozen at `cancelled_at`.
- Refund paid to sender is exactly `deposit_amount - accrued_at(cancelled_at)`.
- `cancel_stream` and `cancel_stream_as_admin` must produce identical state/event semantics except for the required authorizer.

13. **Reentrancy Guard**

All token-transfer paths (`withdraw`, `withdraw_to`, `batch_withdraw`, `cancel_stream`) are protected by an explicit `DataKey::ReentrancyLock` guard. If a cross-contract callback (e.g., via a custom token hook) attempts to re-enter any of these functions while a transfer is in progress, the call will revert with `ContractError::InvalidState`.

14. **Contract balance consistency**  
    Deposit is pulled in `create_stream`; refunds and withdrawals only move amounts derived from that deposit (unstreamed to sender, accrued to recipient). No minting or arbitrary transfers.
