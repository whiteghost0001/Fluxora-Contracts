# Contract event schema

This document lists all events emitted by the `FluxoraStream` contract, the exact
topics used, and the data schema (field names and Rust/Soroban types). Use this
as the canonical source of truth for indexers and backend parsers. The schemas
below are derived directly from the contract source `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs`.

Notes:

- Soroban events contain an ordered list of topics and a single `data` payload.
- Topics shown below are the literal values used in `env.events().publish(...)`.
- Types use the contract's Rust types (e.g. `u64`, `i128`, `Address`).
- Keep this file in sync with the contract when event shapes change.

## Event list

| Event name       | Topic(s)                        | Data (shape & types)                                                                                                                                      | When emitted                                                                                                            |

| StreamToppedUp   | `["top_up", stream_id: u64]`    | `StreamToppedUp { stream_id: u64, top_up_amount: i128, new_deposit_amount: i128 }`                                                                        | When `top_up_stream` successfully increases a stream's deposit.                                                          |
| RecipientUpdated | `["recp_upd", stream_id: u64]` | `RecipientUpdated { stream_id: u64, old_recipient: Address, new_recipient: Address }`                                                                     | When `update_recipient` successfully rotates a stream's receiving address.                                             |

---
| Event name | Topic(s) | Data (shape & types) | When emitted |
|---|---:|---|---|
| StreamCreated | ["created", stream_id] | StreamCreated { stream_id: u64, sender: Address, recipient: Address, deposit_amount: i128, rate_per_second: i128, start_time: u64, cliff_time: u64, end_time: u64 } | When a stream is successfully created (after tokens transferred). The `stream_id` is the newly assigned stream id (u64). The event is published in `persist_new_stream`. Not emitted on failed creation (e.g., `StartTimeInPast`).
| Withdrawal | ["withdrew", stream_id] | Withdrawal { stream_id: u64, recipient: Address, amount: i128 } | When a recipient successfully withdraws accrued tokens. Only emitted when amount > 0.
| StreamPaused | ["paused", stream_id] | StreamEvent::Paused(stream_id) — enum wrapper containing the u64 stream id | When a stream is paused by the sender or admin.
| StreamResumed | ["resumed", stream_id] | StreamEvent::Resumed(stream_id) — enum wrapper containing the u64 stream id | When a paused stream is resumed by the sender or admin.
| StreamCancelled | ["cancelled", stream_id] | StreamEvent::StreamCancelled(stream_id) — enum wrapper containing the u64 stream id | When a stream is cancelled by the sender or admin.
| AdminUpdated | ["admin", "updated"] | (old_admin: Address, new_admin: Address) | When contract admin is rotated via `set_admin`.
| ContractPaused | ["paused_ctl"] | bool | When global pause is set to true or false.

## Exact Soroban event structure

Soroban events are represented as JSON in test snapshots; the general shape is:

- **topics**: array of topic items (symbols or values)
- **data**: a value (single item) which can be a primitive, a struct, or a tuple

### 1) StreamCreated

Emitted by `persist_new_stream` after a successful `create_stream`, `create_streams`, or `create_streams_partial` call.

```
topics: ["created", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamCreated {
          stream_id:       u64,
          sender:          Address,
          recipient:       Address,
          deposit_amount:  i128,
          rate_per_second: i128,
          start_time:      u64,
          cliff_time:      u64,
          end_time:        u64,
          memo:            Option<Bytes>,  // None when not supplied; max 64 bytes
        }
```

Example JSON (illustrative):

```json
{
  "topics": ["created", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "sender": "G...SENDER...",
    "recipient": "G...RECIPIENT...",
    "deposit_amount": 1000,
    "rate_per_second": 1,
    "start_time": 0,
    "cliff_time": 0,
    "end_time": 1000
  }
}
```

### 2) Withdrawal

Emitted by `withdraw` and each stream in `batch_withdraw` when `withdrawable > 0`.

```
topics: ["withdrew", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   Withdrawal {
          stream_id: u64,
          recipient: Address,
          amount:    i128,
        }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["withdrew", 0],
  "data": { "stream_id": 0, "recipient": "G...RECIPIENT...", "amount": 300 }
}
```

### 3) WithdrawalTo

Emitted by `withdraw_to` when `withdrawable > 0`. The `destination` field holds the
address that actually receives the tokens; `recipient` is the stream's registered
recipient (the authorised caller).

```
topics: ["wdraw_to", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   WithdrawalTo {
          stream_id:   u64,
          recipient:   Address,
          destination: Address,
          amount:      i128,
        }
```

### 4) StreamPaused / StreamResumed / StreamCancelled / StreamCompleted / StreamClosed

**StreamPaused** uses the new `StreamPaused` struct (introduced in `CONTRACT_VERSION = 3`):

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct StreamPaused {
    pub stream_id: u64,
    pub reason: PauseReason,
}

#[contracttype]
pub enum PauseReason {
    Operational   = 0,  // Routine sender-initiated pause
    Emergency     = 1,  // Security-related pause
    Compliance    = 2,  // Regulatory/compliance hold
    Administrative = 3, // Admin-initiated pause
}
```

| Function(s)                                                  | Topic         | Data                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `pause_stream`, `pause_stream_as_admin`                      | `"paused"`    | `StreamPaused { stream_id, reason }` |
| `resume_stream`, `resume_stream_as_admin`                    | `"resumed"`   | `StreamEvent::Resumed(id)`         |
| `cancel_stream`, `cancel_stream_as_admin`                    | `"cancelled"` | `StreamEvent::StreamCancelled(id)` |
| `withdraw`, `batch_withdraw` (final drain on Active streams) | `"completed"` | `StreamEvent::StreamCompleted(id)` |
| `close_completed_stream`                                     | `"closed"`    | `StreamEvent::StreamClosed(id)`    |

> **Breaking change (v3):** The `"paused"` event data changed from `StreamEvent::Paused(stream_id)`
> to `StreamPaused { stream_id, reason }`. Indexers must update their pause event parsers.
> `CONTRACT_VERSION` was bumped to `3` to signal this incompatibility.

Example (paused with reason):

```json
{
  "topics": ["paused", 0],
  "data": { "stream_id": 0, "reason": "Operational" }
}
```

`StreamCancelled` does not embed refund or timestamp fields in the payload.
Indexers should read `get_stream_state(stream_id)` to obtain `cancelled_at` and derive refund
from state plus accrual (`refund = deposit_amount - accrued_at_cancelled_at`).

Example (completed — emitted after the Withdrawal event on the same call):

```json
{
  "topics": ["completed", 0],
  "data": { "StreamCompleted": 0 }
}
```

> **Indexers:** the `stream_id` appears both as the second topic and inside the
> enum payload. Read it from the topic for efficiency; use the payload only for
> cross-checking.

### 5) RateUpdated

```
topics: ["rate_upd", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   RateUpdated {
          stream_id:           u64,
          old_rate_per_second: i128,
          new_rate_per_second: i128,
          effective_time:      u64,
        }
```

### 6) StreamEndShortened

```
topics: ["end_shrt", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamEndShortened {
          stream_id:     u64,
          old_end_time:  u64,
          new_end_time:  u64,
          refund_amount: i128,
        }
```

Emission guarantees:
- Emitted exactly once on successful `shorten_stream_end_time`.
- Not emitted on failed shorten calls (`InvalidParams`, `InvalidState`, auth failure).

### 7) StreamEndExtended

```
topics: ["end_ext", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamEndExtended {
          stream_id:    u64,
          old_end_time: u64,
          new_end_time: u64,
        }
```

### 8) StreamToppedUp

This event is emitted only after the top-up has succeeded. Validation failures,
authorization failures, arithmetic overflow, or failed token pulls emit no
`top_up` contract event.

```
topics: ["top_up", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamToppedUp {
          stream_id:          u64,
          top_up_amount:      i128,
          new_deposit_amount: i128,
        }
```

### 9) AdminUpdated

Emitted by `set_admin`.

```
topics: ["AdminUpdated"]
data:   (old_admin: Address, new_admin: Address)
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["AdminUpdated"],
  "data": ["G...OLD_ADDRESS...", "G...NEW_ADDRESS..."]
}
```

### 10) ProtocolPaused

Emitted by `pause_protocol` when the protocol is successfully paused.
**Not emitted** on idempotent calls (when already paused).

```
topics: ["pr_pause", admin: Address]
data:   ProtocolPaused {
          reason: String,
          paused_at: u64,
        }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["pr_pause", "G...ADMIN_ADDRESS..."],
  "data": {
    "reason": "security incident",
    "paused_at": 1234567
  }
}
```

### 11) ProtocolResumed

Emitted by `resume_protocol` when the protocol is successfully resumed.
**Not emitted** on idempotent calls (when not paused).

```
topics: ["pr_resume", admin: Address]
data:   ProtocolResumed {
          resumed_at: u64,
        }
```

Example:

```json
{
  "topics": ["pr_resume", "G...ADMIN_ADDRESS..."],
  "data": {
    "resumed_at": 2345678
  }
}
```

### 12) SenderTransferred

Emitted by `transfer_sender` when the stream sender is successfully rotated.

```
topics: ["sndr_xfr", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   SenderTransferred {
          stream_id:  u64,
          old_sender: Address,
          new_sender: Address,
        }
```

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "topics": ["sndr_xfr", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "old_sender": "G...OLD_SENDER...",
    "new_sender": "G...NEW_SENDER..."
  }
}
```

## On-chain Pause Audit Trail

In addition to events, the contract maintains an on-chain audit trail of the last pause action for each pause kind. This is queryable via `get_last_pause_record(kind: PauseKind)`.

### PauseKind

- `GlobalEmergency`: Toggled via `set_global_emergency_paused`.
- `Protocol`: Toggled via `pause_protocol`.
- `Stream`: Toggled via `pause_stream_as_admin`.

### PauseRecord

```rust
pub struct PauseRecord {
    pub actor: Address,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub reason: String,
}
```

### 14) StreamHealthChanged

Emitted by `decrease_rate_per_second`, `shorten_stream_end_time`, `top_up_stream`,
and `cancel_stream` when the stream's funding health status transitions between
adequately funded and underfunded.

A stream is **underfunded** when `remaining_balance < rate_per_second × seconds_remaining`.
Terminal streams (`Completed`, `Cancelled`) have `seconds_remaining = 0` and are never underfunded.

This event is only emitted when the `is_underfunded` flag actually changes, not on every mutation.

```
topics: ["hlth_chg", <stream_id: u64>]
data:   StreamHealthChanged {
          stream_id:         u64,
          is_underfunded:    bool,
          remaining_balance: i128,
          seconds_remaining: u64,
        }
```

Example (stream became underfunded after rate decrease):

```json
{
  "topics": ["hlth_chg", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "is_underfunded": true,
    "remaining_balance": 500,
    "seconds_remaining": 800
  }
}
```

Example (stream became adequately funded after top-up):

```json
{
  "topics": ["hlth_chg", 0],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 0,
    "is_underfunded": false,
    "remaining_balance": 1200,
    "seconds_remaining": 800
  }
}
```

Indexers should use this event to surface underfunded streams proactively.
The `remaining_balance` and `seconds_remaining` fields allow precise monitoring dashboards.

## Parsing recommendations for indexers


- Use `topics[0]` to filter by event type; use `topics[1]` to get the `stream_id`
  for all stream-level events.
- For `Withdrawal` and `WithdrawalTo`, the `amount` field is `i128` — use a
  big-int library that supports 128-bit signed integers.
- `StreamCompleted` is emitted on the **same call** as the final `Withdrawal` that drains
  an `Active` stream. Cancelled streams do not transition to `Completed`.
- `StreamClosed` signals that the stream's on-chain storage has been removed.
  After this event, `get_stream_state` returns `StreamNotFound` for that ID.
- `AdminUpdated` has a single-element topic list (no stream_id).

> **See [docs/indexer-derivation.md](./indexer-derivation.md)** for the complete
> specification of how to derive stream state from events, when to call
> `get_stream_state`, and worked examples for each lifecycle path (including
> cancellation, rate changes, and completion).

## Factory contract events (`fluxora_factory`)

All state-changing factory entrypoints emit structured events. Topics are ≤ 9
characters (`symbol_short!` constraint). Naming mirrors `FluxoraStream` where
applicable (e.g. `AdminUpd`).

| Event name | Topic(s) | Data (shape & types) | When emitted |
|---|---|---|---|
| FactoryInited | `["fct_init"]` | `FactoryInited { admin: Address, stream_contract: Address, max_deposit: i128, min_duration: u64 }` | Once, when `init` completes successfully. |
| FactoryAdminUpdated | `["AdminUpd"]` | `FactoryAdminUpdated { old_admin: Address, new_admin: Address }` | When `set_admin` rotates the factory admin. |
| StreamContractUpdated | `["stm_upd"]` | `StreamContractUpdated { old_contract: Address, new_contract: Address }` | When `set_stream_contract` changes the stream-contract pointer. |
| AllowlistUpdated | `["allow_upd"]` | `AllowlistUpdated { recipient: Address, allowed: bool }` | When `set_allowlist` adds (`allowed: true`) or removes (`allowed: false`) a recipient. |
| CapUpdated | `["cap_upd"]` | `CapUpdated { old_cap: i128, new_cap: i128 }` | When `set_cap` updates the factory deposit cap. |
| MinDurationUpdated | `["dur_upd"]` | `MinDurationUpdated { old_min_duration: u64, new_min_duration: u64 }` | When `set_min_duration` updates the minimum stream duration policy. |
| RateBoundsUpdated | `["rate_bnd"]` | `RateBoundsUpdated { min_rate: Option<i128>, max_rate: Option<i128> }` | When `set_rate_bounds` updates rate-per-second bounds. `None` = argument not supplied by caller. |
| FactoryPaused/Resumed | `["factory", "paused"]` / `["factory", "resumed"]` | `bool` | When `set_factory_paused` toggles the pause flag (pre-existing). |
| FactoryStreamCreated | `["fct_strm"]` | `FactoryStreamCreated { stream_id: u64, sender: Address, recipient: Address, deposit_amount: i128, rate_per_second: i128 }` | After a policy-gated `create_stream` succeeds. Not emitted on any validation or downstream failure. |

### Example JSON (FactoryStreamCreated)

```json
{
  "topics": ["fct_strm"],
  "data": {
    "stream_id": 42,
    "sender": "G...SENDER...",
    "recipient": "G...RECIPIENT...",
    "deposit_amount": 50000,
    "rate_per_second": 10
  }
}
```

### Example JSON (AllowlistUpdated)

```json
{
  "topics": ["allow_upd"],

## Keeping this doc in sync

This file is derived from `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs` and `contracts/factory/src/lib.rs` emit calls:

- `persist_new_stream` publishes `(symbol_short!("created"), stream_id), StreamCreated { ... }`
- `withdraw` publishes `(symbol_short!("withdrew"), stream_id), Withdrawal { stream_id, recipient, amount }`
- `pause_stream` / `pause_stream_as_admin` publish `(symbol_short!("paused"), stream_id), StreamEvent::Paused(stream_id)`
- `resume_stream` / `resume_stream_as_admin` publish `(symbol_short!("resumed"), stream_id), StreamEvent::Resumed(stream_id)`
- `cancel_stream` / `cancel_stream_as_admin` publish `(symbol_short!("cancelled"), stream_id), StreamEvent::StreamCancelled(stream_id)`
- `set_admin` publishes `(symbol_short!("admin"), symbol_short!("updated")), (old_admin, new_admin)`

If you change event topics or payloads in the contract, please update this
document to match and include example snapshots.
